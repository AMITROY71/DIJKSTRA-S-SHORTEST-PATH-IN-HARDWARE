# DIJKSTRA-S-SHORTEST-PATH-IN-HARDWARE
The main objective of this project is to acceleration of  real time path planning in mobile location with variants of this algorithm could be used in other applications in dynamic network routing.
Integration of platforms Matlab and Verilog in the analysis of locality, selection of the minimum cost and path for navigation are evaluated in this work.
The project was implemented using ISE tools and Spartan -6
•	The main objective of this project is to implement Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm using VGA interfacing and BRAM on the FPGA
•	The application of this project was to implement the routing of the distance measurement and cost  of the path like google maps.
